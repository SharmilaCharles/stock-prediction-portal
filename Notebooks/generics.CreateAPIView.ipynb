    "This code defines a class-based view in Django, specifically using Django REST Framework (DRF) to handle user registration. Here's a detailed explanation of each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `class RegisterView(generics.CreateAPIView):`**\n",
    "- This creates a view for handling user registration.\n",
    "- `CreateAPIView` is a generic view provided by DRF that simplifies the creation of objects in the database via POST requests. It automatically provides functionality for creating a new instance of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `queryset = User.objects.all()`**\n",
    "- `queryset` defines the collection of objects that the view will work with. \n",
    "- Here, it's fetching all the users (`User.objects.all()`) from the `User` model.\n",
    "- The `User` model is typically Django's default user model unless it has been customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. `serializer_class = UserSerializer`**\n",
    "- This specifies the serializer class to be used.\n",
    "- `UserSerializer` is responsible for:\n",
    "  - Validating incoming data (e.g., username, email, password).\n",
    "  - Converting Python objects (like the `User` instance) into JSON for API responses.\n",
    "  - Converting JSON into Python objects for saving into the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. `permission_classes = [AllowAny]`**\n",
    "- This defines the permissions required to access the view.\n",
    "- `AllowAny` means that no authentication is required; anyone can access this view. This is typical for registration endpoints, as unauthenticated users need to register.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Client Sends a POST Request:**  \n",
    "   - When a user submits a registration form, the data (e.g., username, email, password) is sent as a POST request to the URL mapped to this view.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation and Creation:**  \n",
    "   - The `UserSerializer` validates the incoming data to ensure all required fields are present and meet the constraints (e.g., unique username).\n",
    "   - If validation passes, a new user is created in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response:**  \n",
    "   - On success, the view returns a response (usually a 201 Created status) along with the created user's details.\n",
    "   - If validation fails, an error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request) is sent with details of the validation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Workflow**\n",
    "1. **Request:**  \n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   POST /api/register/\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"username\": \"john_doe\",\n",
    "     \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n",
    "     \"password\": \"securepassword\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response:**  \n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"id\": 1,\n",
    "     \"username\": \"john_doe\",\n",
    "     \"email\": \"john@example.com\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Customizing the View**\n",
    "You can customize this view to:\n",
    "- Add extra validation in the serializer.\n",
    "- Send confirmation emails after registration.\n",
    "- Return customized responses.\n"
