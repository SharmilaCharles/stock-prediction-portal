    "### **Understanding `PrivateRoute` and `PublicRoute` in React Router**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both `PrivateRoute` and `PublicRoute` are **higher-order components (HOCs)** that help manage authentication-based routing in a **React app using React Router**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **PrivateRoute - Protecting Routes**\n",
    "`PrivateRoute` ensures that only authenticated users can access certain pages (e.g., `Dashboard`).  \n",
    "If the user **is not logged in**, they will be **redirected to the login page**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **PrivateRoute Implementation**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\";\n",
    "\n",
    "const PrivateRoute = ({ children }) => {\n",
    "  const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem(\"access_token\") !== null; \n",
    "\n",
    "  return isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to=\"/login\" />;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default PrivateRoute;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Checks if the user is authenticated**  \n",
    "   - It reads the `access_token` from `localStorage` to determine if the user is logged in.\n",
    "2. **If logged in → Show the requested page** (`children`).\n",
    "3. **If not logged in → Redirect to the login page** (`/login`) using `<Navigate to=\"/login\" />`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using PrivateRoute in `App.js`**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<Route path=\"/dashboard\" element={<PrivateRoute><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the user **is authenticated**, they see the `Dashboard` page.  \n",
    "- If **not authenticated**, they are redirected to `/login`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **PublicRoute - Preventing Access for Logged-in Users**\n",
    "`PublicRoute` **prevents authenticated users from accessing certain pages** like `Login` or `Register`.  \n",
    "For example, if a logged-in user **tries to visit `/login`**, they should be **redirected to `/dashboard`** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **PublicRoute Implementation**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\";\n",
    "\n",
    "const PublicRoute = ({ children }) => {\n",
    "  const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem(\"access_token\") !== null;\n",
    "\n",
    "  return isAuthenticated ? <Navigate to=\"/dashboard\" /> : children;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default PublicRoute;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Checks if the user is authenticated**  \n",
    "   - Again, it reads `access_token` from `localStorage`.\n",
    "2. **If not logged in → Show the requested page** (`children`).\n",
    "3. **If logged in → Redirect to `/dashboard`** (`<Navigate to=\"/dashboard\" />`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using PublicRoute in `App.js`**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<Route path=\"/login\" element={<PublicRoute><Login /></PublicRoute>} />\n",
    "<Route path=\"/register\" element={<PublicRoute><Register /></PublicRoute>} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the user **is not logged in**, they can access **Login/Register** pages.\n",
    "- If **already logged in**, they are redirected to **Dashboard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Use PrivateRoute & PublicRoute?**\n",
    " **Better User Experience** – Prevents logged-in users from accessing login/register pages.  \n",
    " **Security** – Ensures unauthorized users can’t access protected routes.  \n",
    " **Simple & Reusable** – Easy to manage authentication-based routing."
